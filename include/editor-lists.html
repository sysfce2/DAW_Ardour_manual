<p>
	The Editor and the Cue windows have an optional area called
	<dfn>Editor list</dfn>. It contains multiple lists: tracks and busses,
	sources, regions, reusable clips, various markers etc.
</p>

<figure class="right">
    <img src="/images/editor-list.png" width="300px" alt="Editor list">
    <figcaption>
      Editor list
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	The Editor list is not shown by default when you run Ardour for the first
	time. It can be hidden or shown using <kbd class="menu">View &gt; Show
	Editor List</kbd> menu command.
</p>

<p>
	This area appears on the right side of the window. The left-hand
	border of the list can be dragged to show more columns where
	appropriate (alternatively, you can scroll the bottom scrollbar to see
	more).
</p>

<p>
	The Cue window displays only a part of all possible lists&nbsp;&mdash;
	ones that make sense for this non-linear sequencer: Clips, Tracks, Sources,
	and Regions.
</p>

<p>
	It's possible to quickly switch between two diferent lists. To select a list and switch to it, click on the part of the button that contains a triangle icon pointing downwards. To switch to an already selected list, click the main part of the button.
