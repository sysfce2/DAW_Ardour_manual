	You can record audio and MIDI from respective inputs into trigger slots to play them back. Here is the workflow.

<ol>
	<li>On the Cue page, Click on the record button at the top of
	the track you want to record to. The play buttons for every
	slot turns into a record enable button.</li>
	<li>Select a trigger slot</li>
	<li>Click the recording buttong to the left of the selected trigger slot to enable recording</li>
	<li>Start the transport (typically by clicking the Play button in the transport toolbar or pressing <kbd>Space</kbd>)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  By default, the recording will be 1 bar long; you can change this in
  the clip properties area, using the length dropdown selector above
  the pianoroll:

<p>
  If you select "Until Stopped", then recording will continue until
  you explicitly stop the recording, most typically by pressing the
  space bar on your computer. 
</p>


<p>
	Ardour will count down (the number of beats depends on launch quantization and position of the playhead) and start recording. 
</p>
<p>
	As soon as the playhead reaches the end of the defined recording length, Ardour will stop recording and start playing back the clip you've just recorded.
